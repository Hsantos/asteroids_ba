Asteroids_BA
==========================

An Asteroids-like game made in Unity for learning purposes. It loosely follows the game design rules described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)#Gameplay) and [here](http://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/asteroids/play-guide).

## Building
There is a `build.sh` script that should compile the game for Windows, macOS and Linux. However, the script itself will only work in OS's other than macOS with a few modifications.

## Credits
Most of the assets are made by [Kenney Vleugels](http://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux), used with or without some modification for better fit.

## License
Asteroids_BA is free and unencumbered public domain software. For more information, see the accompanying UNLICENSE file.
